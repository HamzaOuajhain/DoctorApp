# DoctorApp
To see at what stage of a certain treatment the patient is in and decide what should be the next step, doctors are now diving into the patient's file upon a visit and writing down their orders and advice for the other staff. There is a need for a system that smooths the communication between nurses, doctors and departments.


## Three Functionality :

- Authentication and Registration Pages for users 'Doctors-Nurses'.
- Firebase used to store information about the patient.
- Using Barcode Scan to fetch data from the database.
